; We load indirectly the data storage register into R1. 
; We use a polling routine to check if the last bit has been set (is the DSR on?). If it is, then we can move on. 
; We then store the Direct Data register into R0. 
; We restore R1. 
; We then use RET to get out of the TRAP. 

; We are using polling in this example.
